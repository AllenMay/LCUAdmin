"Smart defaults" - Nate Denlinger

## Dependancies
1. Laravel (> laravel make:auth)

## Vision  
To create a Laravel modeule that allows managing users and their security access for an organization.

## From Nate:
A ton of my projects I have built have the same code as a start. Companies, company members with different permission levels, and a monthly price. It is basically what laravel spark is. Some day I'm going to build it as a module so I can just plug it in to any new project.

### Project Work Tasks

1. Build data storage
    1. [organizations]
    2. [users] (using > laravel make:auth)
        - Add [admin]
        - type 'boolean'
    4. [organization_user]
    5. [roles]


### Phases
1. Document Phase
    1. Document high level project detail
    2. Write out description details for each database tables and clases
    3. Go through each table and add all field names
    4. If this is an API document endpoint contract
2. Code Phase
    1.
